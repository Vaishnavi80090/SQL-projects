   SELECT SUM(m.price) as total_amount ,s.customer_id FROM  dbo.sales as s inner
join dbo.menu as m
on s.product_id=m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
order by s.customer_id;

OUTPUT:
total_amount	customer_id
76	A
74	B
36	C


# problem staement -2: by this we get to know how many days they visited  our restaurant.
How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

   SELECT COUNT(distinct(order_date)) as visited_days ,s.customer_id FROM  dbo.sales as s
GROUP BY s.customer_id
order by s.customer_id;

OUTPUT:
visited_days	customer_id
4	A
6	B
2	C

# Problem statement -3:
What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

    WITH a_cte as(
  SELECT s.customer_id,s.order_date,e.product_name,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date)as rank_first_order
  FROM dbo.sales as s
  join 
  dbo.menu as e
  on s.product_id=e.product_id)
  SELECT customer_id,product_name FROM a_cte
  where rank_first_order=1
  group by customer_id,product_name
  
  OUTPUT:
  customer_id	product_name
A	curry
A	sushi
B	curry
C	ramen


#Problem statement -4:

OUTPUT:
       SELECT count(s.product_id) as most_purchased,e.product_name,s.product_id
FROM dbo.sales as s
join
dbo.menu as e

GROUP BY e.product_name,s.product_id
order by most_purchased desc
LIMIT 1

#Problem statement -5:
Which item was the most popular one for each customer?

     with a_cte as
(
SELECT COUNT(s.product_id) as most_purchased,e.product_name,s.customer_id 
  ,DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(s.product_id)desc) as rank 
FROM dbo.sales as s
join
dbo.menu as e
on s.product_id=e.product_id
GROUP BY e.product_name,s.customer_id
)
SELECT most_purchased,product_name,customer_id
FROM a_cte
where rank=1

# OUTPUT:
most_purchased	product_name	customer_id
3	ramen	A
2	curry	B
2	sushi	B
2	ramen	B
3	ramen	C

# PROBLEM STATEMENT -6
Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

with a_cte as(
SELECT s.product_id,s.order_date,s.customer_id,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date desc) as rank
FROM dbo.sales as s
join
dbo.members as e
on s.customer_id=e.customer_id
where s.order_date >= e.join_date
order by s.customer_id,s.product_id desc )
SELECT order_date,customer_id,me.product_name
FROM a_cte
join
dbo.menu as me
on a_cte.product_id=me.product_id
where rank=1

#OUTPUT:
order_date	customer_id	product_name
2021-01-11T00:00:00.000Z	A	ramen
2021-02-01T00:00:00.000Z	B	ramen


#Problem statement-7:
Which item was purchased right before the customer became a member?

with a_cte as(
SELECT s.product_id,s.order_date,s.customer_id,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date desc) as rank
FROM dbo.sales as s
join
dbo.members as e
on s.customer_id=e.customer_id
where s.order_date < e.join_date
order by s.customer_id,s.product_id desc )
SELECT order_date,customer_id,me.product_name
FROM a_cte
join
dbo.menu as me
on a_cte.product_id=me.product_id
where rank=1

#OUTPUT:
order_date	customer_id	product_name
2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z	A	curry
2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z	A	sushi
